# GameOff24
## Process
* First step before working on anything, always fetch from origin first to sync your local branch
* Everyone MUST work on a branch, not main
* Branches should be named with lower case and alphanumeric, no spaces or special characters
* You can have as many branches as you like
* Commit heaps and commit often (this loses less work) - there is no such thing as too many commits
* Push your local changes to your remote branch to sync with GitHub
* Create a pull request for git admin to review and marge or resolve conflicts
